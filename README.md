Yolo (You Looked only once)
This is the simple implementation of the machine learning convolution model in which the following things are being described as per below
Here the following class where functions is being defined as per follows -
Following the conv_blck() and make_yolo() where the whole architecture is being defined and and the model is being created with the input type (None ,None , None , 3)
class Weight Reader is being loaded with the predefined weights and with the following labels which are being taken from the coco model
Now Bounding Box Algorithm is being implemented with the intersectin over union making bounding box .
